French on product labels
Why do products have French on their labels? They should be in Spanish since so many people in the U.S. understand that next to English. Sure, French looks fancy on a label, but not many people understand it.

The only reason I can think of is to make them look elegant and higher quality, but you shouldn't need to throw French on your label to accomplish that!
